Create a Dockerfile:
Create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory:

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use the official Nginx image as the base image
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy custom configuration file to Nginx's configuration directory
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Copy static content (HTML files, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to Nginx's default web root directory
COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to make the web server accessible
EXPOSE 80
Create Nginx configuration file:
Create a file named nginx.conf in the same directory as your Dockerfile. This file will contain the basic configuration for Nginx:

nginx
Copy code
# Set the worker_processes to auto to utilize all available CPU cores
worker_processes auto;

# Define events block
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

# Define HTTP block
http {
    # Define server block
    server {
        # Listen on port 80
        listen 80;

        # Define location block to serve static files
        location / {
            # Set the root directory where static files are located
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;

            # Set index file
            index index.html index.htm;
        }
    }
}
